    "## Introduction about  Web Scraping:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    Web scraping (or data scraping) is a technique used to collect content and data from the internet. This data is usually saved in a local file so that it can be manipulated and analyzed as needed. If youve ever copied and pasted content from a website into an Excel spreadsheet, this is essentially what web scraping is, but on a very small scale.\n",

    "## Introduction about  GitHub website on which  Web Scraping will be done:\n",
    "\n",
    "    At a high level, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. \n",

    "## What is GitHub repository?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A GitHub repository can be used to store a development project.\n",

    "    It can contain folders and any type of files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Documents, Data, Images).\n",
    "\n",
    "    A GitHub repository should also include a licence file and a README file about the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A GitHub repository can also be used to store ideas, or any resources that you want to share.\n",
